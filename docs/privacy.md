# Enlazor Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 17th October 2025  
**App:** Enlazor (macOS)  
**Controller:** Julian Vilas Diaz  
**Contact:** < contact _at_ enlazor.com >

## Summary
We don’t collect, store, or share any personal data. Enlazor works entirely on your Mac to route links to your chosen browser, based on rules you configure.

## What we collect
**We collect no personal information.**
- No account, profile, or identifiers  
- No usage analytics or diagnostics sent to us  
- No crash reports sent to us (unless you choose to email us one)  
- No location, contacts, photos, clipboard, or similar data

## How Enlazor works (on-device)
- Enlazor registers as a default browser/URL handler on macOS.  
- When you open a web link (http/https), Enlazor reads the URL **locally** and applies your local routing rules to forward the link to a target browser.  
- We do **not** transmit URLs to our servers (we don’t operate any) and we do **not** log them.

## Third-party sites & browsers
- When a link opens in a browser (e.g., Safari, Chrome, Firefox), that browser and the destination website may process data under **their** privacy policies.  
- Your locally stored configuration may route links to different browsers or profiles, but Enlazor does not see or send any browsing content to us.

## Children’s privacy
Enlazor does not target children and collects no personal data.

## Crash reports & support emails
- macOS may generate crash logs on your device. We do not receive them automatically.  
- If you email us, we’ll receive the information you choose to send (e.g., your email address and message). We use it solely to respond and **delete it when no longer needed**.

## International transfers
We don’t operate any backend services and perform no data transfers. If you contact us by email, your email provider’s standard processing will apply.

## Legal bases (GDPR / UK GDPR)
Because we do not process personal data in the app, no lawful basis is required for app operation. If you contact support, our lawful basis is **legitimate interests** (responding to your request).

## Security
With no data collected or stored by us from app usage, the primary risks relate to the third-party browsers and websites you choose to open. Please review their privacy notices.

## Your rights
If you’ve emailed us, you can request access, correction, or deletion of that correspondence at any time via **< contact _at_ enlazor.com >**.

## Changes to this policy
If our practices change, we’ll update this page and revise the effective date.
